# Hello World! I'm Trevor.

## What Does That Mean?

 * I'm a Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.
 * I like making things: cool things, dumb things, and things that don't really work.
   I like bringing the crazy ideas in my head to life. Sometimes I finish them, sometimes
   I don't, but I always learn *something*.
 * I'm a swimmer (or, former swimmer). I've learned to thrive under high-pressure
   situations and stay focused on the details.
 * I've been called a perfectionist before because I've written the same code hundreds
   of times to get it perfect. I don't think that's true. I like exploring; looking
   through the endless solutions to find the one that's *just* right.
 * I'm a yapper. I love talking about stuff I find cool, but I also **love** listening to
   stuff other people find cool--even if I'm not smart enough to understand them.
 * I don't drink coffee, but I'm an Earl Grey addict. If you give be a box of Earl Grey tea,
   you will become my favorite person ever.

## What Have I Done?

A lot. Most of my projects are tiny little toys, scattered across accounts and computers.
Now that I'm in college, I decided to create this new Github account (along with a new,
professional email). On one hand, this means that I have a blank slate which is so exciting!
On the other hand, I don't have much to show you. So, here are some cool projects I've done
in the past. You'll have to trust that it's actually me.

* **Juke OS**: This was a project through RPI's Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS).
  It's a large, student-motivated group in RPI where team leaders can pitch open source
  projects and get contributors from a large group of fellow students. I had the opporunity
  to work on the Juke OS team, where I served as a full-stack developer; responsible
  for authentication with Spotify and implementing Web Playback with the Spotify SDK.

  RCOS was a tremendous experience, and I plan on returning next year to lead my own
  project. The project is already in the works, and if you're a swimmer too, it's gonna be
  **awesome**.
* **4D Graphics**: Have you ever seen [Miegakure](https://miegakure.com/)? Inspired by it,
  I did some hacking a while ago to see if I could do something similar. Unfortionately,
  life got in the way, but I hope to get back into it and make it something cool.
  * **4D Raymarching Engine**: Based off the work of the wonderful
    [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/), I expanded traditional 3D raymarching
    algorithms to work in 4D. The math isn't hard, but the results are really cool. Check
    it out!
    [Repository](https://github.com/19UV/4D-Raymarch-Engine).
    [Demo](https://19uv.github.io/4D-Raymarch-Engine/).
  * **Tesseract Cross Section**: Ideally, I want to make a game built around working in and
    puzzling out a 4D space. In order to do this, it's probably a good idea to use
    rasterization 'cause that's what GPUs are built for. Like above, the math isn't hard,
    but it looks REALLY cool.
    [Repository](https://github.com/19UV/Tesseract-Cross-Section).
    [Demo](https://19uv.github.io/Tesseract-Cross-Section/).
  * **Trength Game Engine** (Ongoing, On-Hold): A game engine written in C++ to help develop
    4D games and realize 4D worlds. So far, only early development has occured (primarily
    due to scope creep). I definitely want to do more with this soon.
  * **Physically Based 4D Raytracing** (Ongoing): Inspired by the
    [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) series and the
    [Physically Based Rendering Book](https://pbr-book.org/), I set out to try and expand
    physical phenomena to 4D space to ask the question: *What would 4D look like in the real
    world?* This has a decent timetable, as I hope to bring it to completion once I take
    a formal computer graphics course.
* **Black Hole Simulation**: So many fun projects. So little time. In my senior year of
  high school, my math teacher gave us a project where we had free rein: do some research
  in **something** mathematics and give a presentation on it.

  My group decided to do something borderline trivial: simulation of light around a black
  hole. We based everything on
  [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2653/1/012024)
  by Radjaroendee, Jamraschai, and Hirunsirisawat. We created two projects, one 2D
  simulator ([Repository](https://github.com/BigSpaceships/2D-Blackhole-Sim).
  [Demo](https://bigspaceships.github.io/2D-Blackhole-Sim/).) and one partially complete
  3D simulator ([Repository](https://github.com/TrevorMartin27/3d-blachole-raytracer)).
  Unfortunately, we couldn't get the 3D raytracer working in time, but we were able to get
  some decent visuals from it.

## What Do I Want To Do?

Make cool stuff.

But that's really general. What does that mean:
 * I want to do systems development. I want to better understand what makes computers tick.
 * I want to learn about language development. I've written a few compilers in my time, but
   I want to know how the real developers do it.
 * I want to learn about AI; not LLM prompt development or using an existing model to do
   something it shouldn't. I want to peek into the black box. I want to understand the math
   and logic that makes AI work, and not just LLMs.
 * Quantum computing looks cool. I'm in a quantum computing club, which mostly consists of
   sitting in student-run lectures and trying to decypher what the smart people are talking
   about. Right now, I only understand every other word they say. Soon, I'll understand half
   of what they mean. Later, I plan to teach it.
 * This list is non-exhaustive. There are so many things I'm interested in, that I can't
   even remember it all. There's things I'm interested in that I don't know about yet. That
   just means I don't know enough yet.

## What Can I Do?

That was all really big and general. Sorry for rambling. This is what I can do.

* **Professionally,** I have experience developing a scalable, serverless web app with AWS,
  Python, and Vue.js to provide customers with control over IOT devices. I'm not going to go
  into everything I did (I've gone on long enough), but below are the skills I've learned:
  * **Programming Languages:** Python, VueJS, Javascript
  * **Ecosystems:** AWS. Specifically developing scalable applications using Lambda,
    DynamoDB, API Gateway, S3, and IOT Core.
  * **Soft Skills:** Documentation (ooh boy), Planning (weighing benefits and
    tradeoffs necessary to design and implement a complex feature), Communication, and
    learning to ask good questions.
* **Proficient** in systems that I've written code for, but haven't necessary been able to
  apply in a work environment. I would say I'm good at this (enough to make cool stuff), but
  I still have work to do to write production-ready code.
  * **Programming Languages:** C, C++, React (developing cool project)
  * **Ecosystems:** Google Firebase (cool project)
  * **Soft Skills:** Leadership, Time Management
* **I've touched** with a 5 foot pole but I still want to learn more about.

  This will just be a list: Go, Rust, Typescript, SQL
